        <!-- Instructions -->
        <p><strong>Instructions for use</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li> Choose an NV Energy export file (.csv) that is on your computer by pressing the <i><strong>Browse...</strong></i> button and navigating to the file.</li>
            <li> Once file is chosen, press the <i><strong>Generate graphs</strong></i> button.</li>
            <li> To choose which graphs to see (day grouped, month grouped, or year grouped), check the corresponding checkboxes below.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <!-- Explanation of data -->
        <p> <strong>Explanation of graphed data.</strong></p> 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Power from NV Energy Consumed:</strong> this is the power you used from NV Energy. If you have solar panels, this could be during the night, stormy days, etc. Essentially any time you used more power than you generated.</li>
            <li><strong>Solar excess provided to NV Energy:</strong> this is excess power that you generated (not from NV Energy) that was added back to the grid. For example, this could be during the middle of the day when you aren't home using much power but your solar panels are generating maximum electricity.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Purpose -->
        <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
        <p>The purpose of this web-app is to be an easily readable alternative to NV Energy's own electricity usage graph. I found the NV Energy graph was difficult to decipher the amount of excess electricity my solar panels are sending back to the grid versus the amount of electricity I use from the grid.</p>
